                <h3>This project may help blind or old people to remind them about their medicines to eat. They may
                    set<br>the time they have to eat their medicines so that the alarm may sound at the time they set
                    it. This helps blind people<br>as it automatically openes the drawer at the respective time thay
                    have set it so that they get to know that they have to<br>eat their medicine. If the medicine is
                    finished, then the alarm will make a different sound as a<br>reminder to buy medicine telling them
                    the name of the medicine.</h3>
